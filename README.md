# RPS Deathmatch - Back End

> RPS Deathmatch is an online multiplayer game where opponents may face-off against each other in a tournament style bracket until there is only one champion. Much like Jackbox games, the player will use their phone as the controller and watch the action on a desktop device. If the player doesn't have access to a desktop, they can tilt the phone into landscape mode to see the desktop screen.
